  "description": "Play the most competitive massively multiplayer party royale game featuring beans ever for free on a variety of platforms. Mediatonic\u2019s obstacle course-style game Fall Guys offers players all the excitement of being in a Japanese-style game show \u2013 only as a bean and with less chance of severe injury.\r\n\r\nMake your way through the obstacle course as quickly as possible while avoiding all the dangers, and everyone else who\u2019d like to take you out and take your spot at the top. Make the run by yourself or work together in teams\u2026 until you don\u2019t need your friends any more, that is. Run across spinning tubes with holes in them. Dodge big blades and big balls. Break your way through doors.\r\n And do it all in style, with your choice of bean-shaped costumes.\r\n\r\nPlayers can join their friends across several platforms including PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via the Epic Games Store).\r\n",
